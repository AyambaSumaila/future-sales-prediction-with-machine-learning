📊 Project Title: Sales per Unit vs. Newspaper, TV, and Radio
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of advertising expenditure on sales per unit across three different mediums: Newspaper, TV, and Radio. The goal is to determine which channels most effectively drive sales and provide strategic recommendations for optimizing the marketing budget.
🔑 Key Findings

    📺 TV Advertising:
        Strong Positive Correlation: TV advertising spend shows a significant positive impact on sales per unit, making it the most effective medium in driving sales.

    📻 Radio Advertising:
        Moderate Positive Impact: Radio advertising also contributes positively to sales, though its impact is less pronounced than TV. It remains a cost-effective channel, particularly in targeted markets.

    📰 Newspaper Advertising:
        Weak Correlation: Newspaper ads exhibit the least impact on sales, indicating a potential decline in the effectiveness of print media compared to digital channels.

    🔗 Combined Effect:
        Synergistic Uplift: Using all three mediums together results in a noticeable sales uplift, with TV being the dominant driver. The synergy between TV and Radio advertising is especially strong.
